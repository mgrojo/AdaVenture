Setup on OS-X


If you have a previous installation of the game on your computer, 
then delete it by typing something like:

	rm -fr <game-installation-directory>/<game-dir>

This will save space on your computer's disk drive, and will 
help to avoid confusion.  Each download is self-contained.

Choose an installation directory and move the downloaded 7z file there;  
leaving it in ./Downloads is fine.

For *.7z files, you may use Keka to unpack the game directory.


####################### HiDpi Options ##########################
Note that HighDpi mode on Retina displays is more graphically
demanding.  So on older hardware you might want to disable
HighDpi.  One way is to manually edit the file:

	~/<appname>.app/Contents/Info.plist

so that the last line is <false/>.  I.E. instead of

	<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
	<true/>

you should put

	<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
	<false/>

Another way is to edit the app startup "info" to begin in 
Low Resolution.

Note that these methods affect the app started in the Mac way,
using Finder.  They do NOT affect the app if started from 
a command line terminal, thusly:		

	adaventure_osx

Currently, AdaVenture is setup so that the above command
starts the app @ HighDpi because testing seems to indicate
no noticeable graphical problems on fairly old hardware.
