GNU Ada [GNAT] on Linux
=======================

A GNAT build seems to require using the patchelf 
command to modify shared libraries with inter-
dependencies.

This is NOT the case using AdaCore.

One example: the freetype library needs to
know, at link time, where it can find the PNG
library it requires, assuming that a  usable
system lib with the same name is not found.
The ldd command applied to the executable 
makes this clear. 

Typically the PNG library is collocated, 
in which case the command:

patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' libfreetype.so.6.16.0

tells freetype that any dependencies can be
found in the same directory.

Using GNU Ada, the link will fail without this modification.

This preparation has already been done, here.
