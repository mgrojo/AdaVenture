Note that the big DOTS give possible black key locations
which are randomly chosen;

and the shaded areas are beetle infestation zones.

If a key must be retrieved from a shaded area,
please hurry, for 2 reasons:
	1) carnivorous beetles;
	2) a bat might grab it before you pick it up...
		if you drop your sword to pick up the key
		then be prepared to retrieve it later.
